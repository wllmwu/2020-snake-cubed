# Snake, Cubed

A fresh take on an arcade classic, brought to life with augmented reality!

## Description

Snake, Cubed is, well, snake in a cube. It turns the 2D squares of the traditional game into neat 3D cubes, adding a whole new dimension to this arcade classic while keeping its simple-yet-fun style.

The goal is straightforward: eat apples to grow and increase your score. As you play Snake, Cubed, you'll sharpen your depth perception and spatial awareness. And once you've got the skills, it becomes super satisfying to play!

The game features:
- Augmented-reality gameplay—place the game box anywhere, and start playing! Size is adjustable, perfect for locations from a small desk to an open floor. Move around during the game and find your best angle!
- Tutorial mode—3D gameplay can be challenging at first. Ease yourself into it with the tutorial, and it'll be no sweat!
- Hard mode—pretty much the opposite of tutorial mode. Give yourself a challenge!
- Fancy color schemes—pick your favorite flavor! Also, some of them are designed to make the game more challenging. Combine them with hard mode to achieve true mastery!
- In-game store—collect gold to unlock hard mode, additional color schemes, and more!

Colorblind accessibility options are included. Now get out there, eat them apples, grab that gold, and avoid the… bad apples….
